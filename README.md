Tubifarry is a versatile plugin for **Lidarr** that enhances your music library by fetching metadata from **Spotify** and enabling direct music downloads from **YouTube**. While it is not explicitly a Spotify-to-YouTube downloader, it leverages the YouTube API to seamlessly integrate music downloads into your Lidarr setup. Built on the foundation of trevTV's projects, Tubifarry also supports **Slskd**, the Soulseek client, as both an **indexer** and **downloader**, allowing you to tap into the vast music collection available on the Soulseek network. 🛠️  

Additionally, Tubifarry supports fetching soundtracks from **Sonarr** (series) and **Radarr** (movies) and adding them to Lidarr using the **Arr-Soundtracks** import list feature. This makes it easy to manage and download soundtracks for your favorite movies and TV shows. 🎬🎵

### YouTube Downloader Setup 🎥 
> #### YouTube Warning ⚠️
> Please be aware that YouTube often blocks Tubifarry as a bot. We are currently waiting for external updates. Logging in and the YouTube-only indexer are disabled for now. If login is necessary, please revert to versions earlier than 1.6.0. We appreciate your patience and understanding during this time.

Tubifarry allows you to download music directly from YouTube. Follow the steps below to configure the YouTube downloader.  

#### **Configure the Indexer**:  
1. Navigate to `Settings -> Indexers` and click **Add**.  
2. In the modal, select `Tubifarry` (located under **Other** at the bottom).  

#### **Setting Up the YouTube Download Client**:  
1. Go to `Settings -> Download Clients` and click **Add**.  
2. Select `Youtube` from the list of download clients.  
3. Set the download path and adjust other settings as needed.  
4. **Optional**: If using FFmpeg, ensure the FFmpeg path is correctly configured.  

#### **FFmpeg and Audio Conversion**:  
1. **FFmpeg**: FFmpeg can be used to extract audio from downloaded files, which are typically embedded in MP4 containers. If you choose to use FFmpeg, ensure it is installed and accessible in your system's PATH or the specified FFmpeg path. If not, the plugin does attempt to download it automatically during setup. Without FFmpeg, songs will be downloaded in their original format, which may not require additional processing.  

   **Important Note**: If FFmpeg is not used, Lidarr may incorrectly interpret the MP4 container as corrupt. While FFmpeg usage is **recommended**, it is not strictly necessary. However, to avoid potential issues, you can choose to extract audio without re-encoding, but this may lead to better compatibility with Lidarr.

2. **Max Audio Quality**: Tubifarry supports a maximum audio quality of **256kb/s AAC** for downloaded files through YouTube. While most files are in 128kbps AAC by default, they can be converted to higher-quality formats like **AAC, Opus or MP3v2** if FFmpeg is used.  

   **What is AAC?**  
   AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) is a high-quality audio format that offers better sound quality than MP3 at similar bitrates. It is commonly used in MP4 containers, making it a versatile and widely supported format.  

   **Note**: For higher-quality audio (e.g., 256kb/s), you need a **YouTube Premium subscription**.

### Fetching Soundtracks from Sonarr and Radarr 🎬🎵  
Tubifarry also supports fetching soundtracks from **Sonarr** (for TV series) and **Radarr** (for movies) and adding them to Lidarr using the **Arr-Soundtracks** import list feature. This allows you to easily manage and download soundtracks for your favorite movies and TV shows.  

To enable this feature:  
1. **Set Up the Import List**:  
   - Navigate to `Settings -> Import Lists` in Lidarr.  
   - Add a new import list and select the option for **Arr-Soundtracks**.  
   - Configure the settings to match your Sonarr and Radarr instances.  
   - Provide a cache path to store responses from MusicBrainz for faster lookups.  

2. **Enjoy Soundtracks**:  
   - Once configured, Tubifarry will automatically fetch soundtracks from your Sonarr and Radarr libraries and add them to Lidarr for download and management.

### Queue Cleaner 🧹  

The **Queue Cleaner** automatically processes items in your Lidarr queue that have **failed to import**. It ensures your library stays organized by handling failed imports based on your preferences.  

1. **Key Options**:  
   - *Blocklist*: Choose to remove, blocklist, or both for failed imports.  
   - *Rename*: Automatically rename album folders and tracks using available metadata.  
   - *Clean Imports*: Decide when to clean—when tracks are missing, metadata is incomplete, or always.  
   - *Retry Finding Release*: Automatically retry searching for a release if the import fails.  

2. **How to Enable**:  
   - Navigate to `Settings -> Connect` in Lidarr.  
   - Add a new connection and select the **Queue Cleaner**.  
   - Configure the settings to match your needs.

### Codec Tinker 🎛️

**Codec Tinker** is a feature in Tubifarry that lets you **convert audio files** between different formats using FFmpeg. Whether you want to standardize your library or optimize files for specific devices, Codec Tinker makes it easy to tinker with your audio formats.

#### How to Enable Codec Tinker

1. Go to `Settings > Metadata` in Lidarr.  
2. Open the **Codec Tinker** MetadataConsumer.  
3. Toggle the switch to enable the feature.  

#### How to Use Codec Tinker

1. **Set Default Conversion Settings**  
   - **Target Format**:  
     Choose the default format for conversions (e.g., FLAC, Opus, MP3).  

   - **Custom Conversion Rules**:  
     Define rules like `wavTOflac` or `AAC_to_MP3` for specific format conversions.  

   **Note**: Lossy formats (e.g., MP3, AAC) cannot be converted to non-lossy formats (e.g., FLAC, WAV).  

2. **Enable Format-Specific Conversion**  
   Toggle checkboxes to enable conversion for specific formats:  
   - **Convert MP3**, **Convert AAC**, **Convert FLAC**, etc.

## Troubleshooting 🛠️  

- **Slskd Download Path Permissions**:  
  Ensure Lidarr has read/write access to the Slskd download path. Verify folder permissions and confirm the user running Lidarr has the necessary access. For Docker setups, double-check that the volume is correctly mounted and permissions are properly configured.  

- **FFmpeg Issues (Optional)**:  
  If you’re using FFmpeg and songs fail to process, ensure FFmpeg is installed correctly and accessible in your system’s PATH. If issues persist, try reinstalling FFmpeg or downloading it manually.  

- **Metadata Issues**:  
  If metadata isn’t being added to downloaded files, confirm the files are in a supported format. If using FFmpeg, check that it’s extracting audio to compatible formats like AAC embedded in MP4 containers. Review debug logs for further details.  

- **No Release Found**:  
  If no release is found, YouTube may flag the plugin as a bot. To avoid this and access higher-quality audio, log in using cookies:  
  1. Install the **cookies.txt** extension for your browser:  
     - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc)  
     - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/)  
  2. Log in to YouTube and save the `cookies.txt` file in a folder accessible by Lidarr.  
  3. In Lidarr, go to **Indexer and Downloader Settings** and provide the path to the `cookies.txt` file.  

- **No Lyrics Imported**:  
  To save `.lrc` files (lyric files), navigate to **Media Management > Advanced Settings > Import Extra Files** and add `lrc` to the list of supported file types. This ensures lyric files are imported and saved alongside your music files.  

- **Unsupported Formats**: Verify custom rules and target formats.
